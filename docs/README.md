# Malawi Pay Standard

> The open-source plumbing for Malawi's digital financial future.

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Malawi Payment Interoperability Standard (MW-Standard)**. 

## What is this?
The Malawi Pay Standard is a non-proprietary, open-source set of specifications and software libraries designed to bridge the gap between different financial providers in Malawi (Airtel Money, TNM Mpamba, and Commercial Banks).

## Why we need it
Currently, Malawian digital finance is fragmented. Merchants often need three different phones to accept payments from three different carriers, and users often pay high fees or face technical blockers when sending money across networks.

This standard provides:
1. **Interoperable QRs (UMQR)**: One QR code for all providers.
2. **Unified Data Format (MW-JSON)**: A standard way to describe a transaction.
3. **Decentralized Discovery (MW-ALS)**: A human-readable way to send money (e.g., `@chifundo`).

## Get Started
If you are a developer looking to integrate these standards into your Malawian app, head over to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.
